# Flute

A C++20 fixed-point single header library.

⚠️ This project is a work in progress, use at your own risk.

## Features

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Since this is a header only library, all you need is a C++23 compiler.

### Installing

It's a single header library, so there's nothing to install.

All you need is to include `flute.hpp` in your C++ files.

## Building the project

It's a header only library, include `flute.hpp` and build your source files as usual.
